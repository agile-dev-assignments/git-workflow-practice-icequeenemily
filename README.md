This article is interesting in that it analyzes the effects, both positive and negative, of software development from home. In terms of the productivity of software engineers, the "number of commits" had initially gone down in March 2020 when the switch to work from home took place. However, productivity has either remained the same or increased over the work from home period, as written in a GitHub productivity report.

Software Engineering Managers have commented on the importance of regular team one-on-ones and remaining in contact as frequently as possible. The importance of video chat is evident during this trying time, as people work better when they are getting some type of interaction with team members. What remains missing during this remote work for software engineering teams is casual, social conversations between colleagues that lead to new ideas and solutions to problems.
