## "Coronavirus: Managing software development during lockdown"
https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Coronavirus-Managing-software-development-during-lockdown


This article is interesting in that it analyzes the effects, both positive and negative, of software development from home. In terms of the productivity of software engineers, the "number of commits" had initially gone down in March 2020 when the switch to work from home took place. However, productivity has either remained the same or increased over the work from home period, as written in a GitHub productivity report.

Software Engineering Managers have commented on the importance of regular team one-on-ones and remaining in contact as frequently as possible. The importance of video chat is evident during this trying time, as people work better when they are getting some type of interaction with team members. What remains missing during this remote work for software engineering teams is casual, social conversations between colleagues that lead to new ideas and solutions to problems.

## Comment by Brian Steinberg (bts308)
One thing I found particularly nice from this article was the comment from Matt Yonkovit, where he mentions that they have set up channels on Slack centered around more everyday things (pets, cooking, and sports, to name a few). I think that this addition, though seemingly minor, helps foster a more lifelike working enviornment. I know that personally it has been hard through the pandemic to just focus on work while also being starved of the more common (and somewhat under-appreciated, pre-pandemic) elements of working with other people, such as those random conversations that strengthen your relationships with your coworkers beyond work-related things. Great read!
